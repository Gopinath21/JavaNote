 For methods not applicable  combination (illegal Combination) :-

abstract - {native,final,strictfp,static,synchronized,private}

a- {p nfs ss}
NOte : for methods 6 combination are illegeal 
[ap nfs ss]



Need to Verify:=


abstact class A{

public void m1();
}
 
stictfp & native comination is illegall for methods . I am hoping below things is also illegal combination.

strictfp class A{

	static{
		System.loadLibrarys("");
}

public native void m1();
}
