A JAR file is zip or a tar file in Unix,

JAR = Compiled classes with entire directory structure + MANIFEST.MF file in the META-INF directory .

Eg 

duke/
|------items/
|         |---Clothing.class
|         |---Shirt.class
|         |----- .....
|
|-------purchase/
|         |----Customer.class
|         |-----Order.class
|
|
|-----------META-INF/
            |---MANIFEST.MF
            
MANIFEST.MF file tells the java runtime which file contains the main() method.
